Jesse and her best friend <<give me a name>> went to Disney World today! 
They saw a <<give me a noun>> in a show at the Magic Kingdom 
and ate a <<give me an adjective>> feast for dinner. 
The next day I ran <<give me an adverb>> to meet Mickey Mouse in his 
<<give me a noun>> and then that night I gazed at the <<give me a number>> 
<<give me an adjective>> fireworks shooting from the <<give me a noun>>.
